# My First Platformer
I'm working on making a platformer as my first game development project

This platformer will have the gimmik of automaticly scrolling so its a race against the clock.
This will all be written in python using object oriented style programming.
Just some notes for anyone who reads this code this will hurt your eyes tremedously I am not very
good at programming but I always like things hard so I can learn about usefull topics that I will apply.
