# My First Platformer
I'm working on making a platformer as my first game development project

This platformer will have the gimmik of automaticly scrolling so its a race against the clock.
This will all be written in python using object oriented style programming.
Just some notes for anyone who reads this code this will hurt your eyes tremedously I am not very
good at programming but I always like things hard so I can learn about usefull topics that I will apply.

  Im working on jumping the code doesnt work right now because I got fustrated and it got late I will fix it

December 13,
 Im still trying new things Im now thinking about everything running together so imma reprogram it so the input reading,
 collision detection and updating position all happen before restarting the loop time for v4
 Also im going to make a function to make the display coords into real coords now that im thinking I will
 initiate the x and y with the transformation of cordinates
